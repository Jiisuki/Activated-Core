\begin{quote}
  \large{\textit{\ac\ is a game which intends to mix several game genres, including platforming, action, puzzle and more. The first version was only a tile based platformer, which then expanded beyond the tiles with large bitmapped maps. This allowed for fast rendering which was needed back in the days. The game was originally programmed in Visual Basic, using the extraordinary powers of DirectDraw 4 in the DirectX library. This was year 2004. By the means of switching permanently to Linux, the development of this version faded gradually and eventually died out, until May 20:th 2010. The game development was then restarted, resulting in a completely rewritten game engine in C/C++ using OpenGL and GLUT.}}
